I have been using dropbox for over 2 years now and it is an awesome tool which has saved me countless of times when I needed a file or document. Currently I have about 15 GB of files synced between all my computers all the time and if I am ever without a computer I can always access the dropbox website from any computer and download the needed files. For extra security I have also added my phone number to my dropbox account in case my password ever gets compromised. I also have the dropbox app for both my iPhone and iPad which syncs any ebooks I have directly to my device where I can then move the ebook to my iBooks app without the need to plug it in and sync it with my computer through itunes.
