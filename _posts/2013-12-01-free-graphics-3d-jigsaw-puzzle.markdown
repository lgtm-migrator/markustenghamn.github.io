Whenever I am in need of some ideas for graphics or I just need some simple graphics for a project I always go to [GraphicRiver](http://graphicriver.net/?ref=Bigideaguy "GraphicRiver"). They feature some really talented artists with good work at reasonable prices.  
  
 This month they are featuring a [3D jigsaw puzzle](http://graphicriver.net/item/3d-jigsaw-puzzle/64582?WT.ac=free_file&WT.seg_1=free_file&WT.z_author=fractma&ref=Bigideaguy "3D Jigsaw Puzzle") as a free giveaway.
