I have seen examples of Google doing something like this when you [search for specific things on their website and a sort of job offer pops up](http://developers.slashdot.org/story/15/08/27/2140221/google-may-try-to-recruit-you-for-a-job-based-on-your-search-queries). This is a much simpler example of this but still something that can come across as pretty cool as web developers stumble across it. I was messing around with things on a swedish website called hitta.se, they provide information on both businesses and private people, a sort of searchable directory. As I was looking around I opened the console and saw the following pop up.

I think it is a pretty cool way to catch the interest of developers. It may not reach tons of people but you can be pretty sure that this "ad" is pretty well targeted and it definitely got my attention when I saw it. It is also so simple and I wish that more companies would do this, even better if it is done as a secret easter egg as it shows that the company can be a bit clever and the developer will feel sort of special as he or she managed to find this easter egg by accident and perhaps no one else did.  
  
 This sort of thing is very simple to do, just add some javascript code like

`console.log('Your message goes here');<br></br><br></br>`  
 and it will echo out your message to the console whenever someone visits your website. If they have their console open which usually only web developers will have then they should see the message. Of course you can always ask a skilled web developer to hide the message as an easter egg if you can set a specific criteria for who you want to hire. As Google might do when someone searches for a solution to complicated code. Wether or not you could do this on your own website depends on what your company does, be creative, there is always a way to do something.
