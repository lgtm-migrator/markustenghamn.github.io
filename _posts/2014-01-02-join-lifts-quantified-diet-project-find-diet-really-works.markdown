I mentioned Lift when I wrote about [The 10 Most Innovative Startups 2013](http://markustenghamn.com/10-innovative-startups-2013 "10 Most Innovative Startups"). I still use Lift today and it is a great motivational app. Now they are starting the ["Quantified Diet Project"](https://lift.do/quantified-diet "Quantified Diet Project") in order to find out which diet really works! **Get healthier and be a part of science!** "Let's challenge the diet industry's fuzzy claims about what diets actually work. You'll get healthier, plus you'll help pioneer a new way to do science research on a large scale that hasn't been possible before. We're designing the study with advice from researchers at UC Berkeley and Stanford." I am going to give it a try myself, I had already gotten started on a diet and this will be a great compliment to add additional motivation to that plan. The Paleo diet which I will be doing fits pretty nicely with my original plan and I will be starting my first meal according to this diet tonight!
