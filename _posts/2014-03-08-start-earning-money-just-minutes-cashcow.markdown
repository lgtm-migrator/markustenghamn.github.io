[CashCow](http://codecanyon.net/item/cashcow-affiliate-based-money-making-system/4723003?ref=Bigideaguy "CashCow") is a [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/ "Wordpress") plugin from codecanyon which makes it super easy to get going as an envato affiliate. All you will need to do is to get a domain, setup your [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/ "Wordpress") site and configure the plugin. I used an old domain that I had laying around and had this all done in less than 10 minutes and you can too! To get started you will need a [domain name](http://ref.name.com/SHqL "Domain names at Name.com"), I highly recommend that you use [Name.com](http://ref.name.com/SHqL "Name.com")! Feel free to read [my review on the best domain registrars](http://markustenghamn.com/worst-domain-registrars-review-2013 "Best And Worst Domain Registrars â€“ My Review 2013") and why I use [Name.com](http://ref.name.com/SHqL "Name.com") when I register my domain names. Remember to get some hosting while you are at it if you don't have a web host already. Name.com is a good provider of hosting as well. Once you have that out of the way you will need to install [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/ "Wordpress")! If you are using Name.com you could easily get this done with their [one click installer](http://support.name.com/entries/21479798-How-do-I-install-WordPress-on-a-domain-in-my-hosting-account- "Install Wordpress Name.com") otherwise you can download and install Wordpress from [here](http://wordpress.org/ "Wordpress"). Now to the [CashCow](http://codecanyon.net/item/cashcow-affiliate-based-money-making-system/4723003?ref=Bigideaguy "CashCow") plugin, you can get the plugin from [this page](http://codecanyon.net/item/cashcow-affiliate-based-money-making-system/4723003?ref=Bigideaguy "CashCow"). Simply upload and install this to your wordpress site, you will find instructions along with the files you download. I set my site up at [AtticPop.com](http://atticpop.com/ "AtticPop") since I figured it was a pretty generic name that I wasn't using. I set my tagline to "Site Layouts and Themes!" and then headed over to the [CashCow](http://codecanyon.net/item/cashcow-affiliate-based-money-making-system/4723003?ref=Bigideaguy "CashCow") configuration page. You will see my configuration in the image below, basically I get all the new posts from Themeforest and generate categories automatically. You will need to have an envato account, if you don't have one you can create one [here](https://account.envato.com/sign_up?to=codecanyon&ref=Bigideaguy "Sign Up - Envato") and then navigate to the [affiliate section](http://codecanyon.net/make_money/affiliate_program?ref=Bigideaguy "Envato Affiliates") to learn more. [(image removed)](http://markustenghamn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cashcow-1.png) If I wanted to I could get more technical and do a better job of organizing the posts but this was enough to get me going. I used the theme that comes with [CashCow](http://codecanyon.net/item/cashcow-affiliate-based-money-making-system/4723003?ref=Bigideaguy "CashCow") which worked nicely but may look a bit boring. This is what my site looks like today. [(image removed)](http://markustenghamn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cashcow-3.png) I may work on it more, we will see, for now it is sort of promoting itself. I am simply letting the traffic that was already going there generate the sales and hoping that Google will be nice and rank the site high up on the search results. This is the first time I mention the site since I got it going and as you can see below, I have already earned enough as an affiliate to pay for the [CashCow](http://codecanyon.net/item/cashcow-affiliate-based-money-making-system/4723003?ref=Bigideaguy "CashCow") plugin. [(image removed)](http://markustenghamn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cashcow-2.png) Sure, it may not be much. However if I actually promoted the site I could probably earn a lot more. If you do the same then you should have no problem earning money! Below are some of the features of the CashCow plugin. - Automatic Post Creation
