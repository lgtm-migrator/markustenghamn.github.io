Ok so I seem to be getting close to being done with the new look of the site, not sure if I like it yet, but websites will keep changing and growing for as long as you keep one running, it is important for it to evolve. I added the twitter feed to give better news and info and hopefully it will lead to some more followers as well. Now I just need to work on getting some more content written for the blog on this site. As I am working on this I am also working on some new stuff for Markspixel.com and Markspixel.se, I looked at the main page and figured I needed something to spice it up a bit, the current look was soo dull. Recently I have also moved to Sweden and the thing that bothers me the most right now is the language, I am good at Swedish but I can't remember some of the large words and I totally lack the web design terminology which I feel makes it harder for me to get Markspixel.se started. However I have met some new people who work in the same area as me and I am learning quickly. I recently went to a UF assembly, UF stands for businesses in sweden which are usually started by kids in high school as part of their curriculum, and I found it to be very intereseting. One of the businesses I found was [GOPLUS.se](http://goplus.se/), whom won a prize for best website design, their business is just like Markspixel's, they make websites for businesses and their plan is to keep the company going after high school as well and I am looking forward to see how they progress. Anyways that's all for now, I will keep this updated with more posts as I think of something or something happends.
