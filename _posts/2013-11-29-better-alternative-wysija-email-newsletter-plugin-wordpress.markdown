I had been using Wysija to send out newsletters to my subscribers for a while now. However as my list of subscribers grows it is becoming harder and harder to manage and therefore I had to find an alternative to Wysija which was not up to the task. In this case I stumbled upon a nice WordPress plugin called [MyMail](http://codecanyon.net/item/mymail-email-newsletter-plugin-for-wordpress/3078294?ref=Bigideaguy "MyMail") which has been feaured on [CodeCanyon](http://codecanyon.net/?ref=Bigideaguy "CodeCanyon"), one of my favorite places to look for scripts and ideas. After looking through the features I immediately bought the plugin and tried it on my blog. What can I say? I love it! It simply works and does everything I want it to do. Let's begin with the template system. [(image removed)](http://markustenghamn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/mymail1.jpg) As you can see above, it is nice, clean and easy to use. The thorough documentation gives a great understanding of how to use the template tags to automatically fill in information for posts. In this case I had the template set up as an "autoresponder" which will send an automatic email to any one of the lists I have 10 minutes after I make a post. Scheduling is easy as you can see below. [(image removed)](http://markustenghamn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/mymail2.png) Here I can choose how long the autoresponder should wait before sending out my newsletter. I can of course change the reason why it was sent out. Currently I have this set to "something has been published" however I can change this to trigger on a new user registration for example. I can even test how "spammy" my mail is and directly send a test email to see how things look. Importing my list of subscribers from Wysija was easy as Wysija allows for a CSV export which you can simly drag and drop in the form shown below. [(image removed)](http://markustenghamn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/mymail3.jpg) In addition, the settings for this plugin are extensive which makes it soo much better than anything else I have used. Here I can handle bounced messages. [(image removed)](http://markustenghamn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/mymail4.jpg) It also had a nice little feature to help me setup SPF records and DKIM as seen here. [(image removed)](http://markustenghamn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/mymail6.jpg) Overall I am really impressed with this plugin and it even came with a nice little widget :) [(image removed)](http://markustenghamn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/mymail5.jpg) Before I found [MyMail](http://codecanyon.net/item/mymail-email-newsletter-plugin-for-wordpress/3078294?ref=Bigideaguy "MyMail") I had looked at possibly using Mailchimp or Wysija's premium. However, after finding [MyMail](http://codecanyon.net/item/mymail-email-newsletter-plugin-for-wordpress/3078294?ref=Bigideaguy "MyMail") I am extremely satisfied with running my own newsletter service. Please let me know if I missed anything! I would love to hear your experiences with newsletter services and plugins. Feel free to get in touch with me at any time.
