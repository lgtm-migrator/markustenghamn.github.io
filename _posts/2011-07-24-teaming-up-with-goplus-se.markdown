I have found a very good and promising design firm located in Västerås Sweden. I have mentioned GoPlus in a previous post when i found them at a UF assembly I attented, I spoke to them and mentioned my business and what I do and we kept in touch discussing a possible cooperation or deal between us where I could take care of some of the projects they didn't have time for. GoPlus seems to keep expanding their business and are now doing a lot of advertising for fairly large companies and even buying and assembling a large 170" LED screen which will be used for one of the local bowling and pool rooms in the area. Well I finally got a chance to sit down and discuss things with them and I have found out that I will probably be in charge of all of the web design projects in the near future and I am now listed on their contact page ([http://goplus.se/?page\_id=45](http://goplus.se/?page_id=45)) for web and IT. I hope this works out, I feel that GoPlus has a lot of potential and things are going extremely well right now. I will update this as more things happen.
