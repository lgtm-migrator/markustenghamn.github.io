It's a new month and that means more free stuff from the [Envato](http://anve.to/hEXRF "Envato Marketplace") marketplace! This month we have many cool items with a total value of $151 which you can download completely free just by signing up at [Envato](http://anve.to/hEXRF "Envato Marketplace")!

### [All Mixed Up!](http://anve.to/FF676 "All Mixed Up Video Template")

 This is a beautiful video template that you can edit with Adobe After Effects. Your logo will initially be drawn in what looks like pencil and then it is gradually filled in with colors. The colors then start getting filled in with their 3D layers adding a 3D look to your logo. This could be a very nice intro if you are someone who makes youtube videos for example. Maybe a nice intro or outro if you are looking to get customers to remember your name in a TV ad. You can get your free file, this month only, by clicking[here](http://anve.to/FF676 "All Mixed Up Video Template"). \[caption id="attachment\_5737" align="aligncenter" width="590"\][(image removed)](http://anve.to/Xgsrd "Black Pepper On Wooden Spoon") Black pepper on wooden spoon\[/caption\] ### [Black Pepper On Wooden Spoon](http://anve.to/Xgsrd "Black Pepper On Wooden Spoon")

 This is a pretty nice picture of a wooden spoon with peppers. This could be used for a cooking site for example. I could see it being perfect for a parallax theme if you could combine it with other images or stretch it enough so that it looks good spanning the width of the page. You can get this high resolution of image by clicking [here](http://anve.to/Xgsrd "Black Pepper On Wooden Spoon"). \[caption id="attachment\_5738" align="aligncenter" width="590"\][(image removed)](http://anve.to/TMIQe "Doctype - A Flat and Minimal Portfolio Theme") Doctype Theme\[/caption\] ### [Doctype - A Flat and Minimal Portfolio Theme](http://anve.to/TMIQe "Doctype - A Flat and Minimal Portfolio Theme")

 I love this theme, it's very simplistic, uses Wordpress and looks great! I could see a graphic designer, web developer, writer, photographer and many other professionals using a theme like this one. The following is an excerpt from the Themeforest description. > Doctype is a minimalistic portfolio theme for Wordpress, an ideal solution for creative professionals that love flat design and clean, sharp styles. 100% responsive and retina-display ready, this is a theme that will be ready to launch live in no-time, and will keep you happy for a long time.
