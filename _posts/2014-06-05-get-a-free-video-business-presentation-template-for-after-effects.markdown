> ****\*\*WATCH IN FULL HD****  **<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj6Rb9a6BZA> <http://vimeo.com/32347558> “The Business Presentation” is something really different from DJORDJEVLA here on Videohive. We’ve created this one with faith that it would be something really good to present your firm, company, corporation and to present yourself in one pretty different way to your clients! So, I think we’ve managed (image removed) . It is FULL HD \[1920×1080\] CS4 + well-organized project without any 3rd plugins. Everything you need to customize it is your AECS4 or higer. We’ve got here 6 places for your pictures or videos, 7 places for your text and, in the end, place for your LOGO and some information! Pictures used in preview are my own, and you can purchase some of them on PHOTODUNE . There is a help file, too, which will help you to customize this one without any problems! Audio used in preview can be purchased separately from: [http://audiojungle.net/item/corporate-summer-with-driving-remix/106397?WT.ac=search\_item&WT.seg\_1=search\_item&WT.z\_author=plastic3](http://audiojungle.net/item/corporate-summer-with-driving-remix/106397?WT.ac=search_item&WT.seg_1=search_item&WT.z_author=plastic3&ref=Bigideaguy) Sound effects mixed with audio are my own mix, and if you need them, I can send you after purchase.** Thanks for your time! **Also, DO NOT forget to RATE !!!**\*\* (image removed)
