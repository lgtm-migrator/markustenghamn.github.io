It's now been over a year since I wrote my
previous review of the best and worst domain registrars.
This year I will be taking a broader look at some of the most popular domain registrars,
including Name.com (last years best) and Godaddy (last years worst).

## [THE BEST - NameSilo (GOOD)](http://www.namesilo.com/?rid=ee81e92mn "NameSilo")

[NameSilo](http://www.namesilo.com/?rid=ee81e92mn "NameSilo") is another registrar which is new
to me. I have not used them before but their pricing at $8.99 is cheap with discounts starting
at more than 9 domains. Privacy and protection is also included in the price. In addition
to all this good stuff they also have easy one click access to all my domain names. Setting
up an account was easy and did not require me to buy anything. Paying for a domain is also
easy with many payment options (even bitcoin). Their user interface could be nicer perhaps
but it is not overly complicated at all. The only negative thing I could find is that they
don't support very many domain extensions but I am ok with that as I have mostly .com as
they are still the most trusted and popular. Their support seemed very helpful and checking
 reviews only supports my findings as you can see [here](http://www.customerservicescoreboard.com/NameSilo "NameSilo Reviews")
 and [here](http://www.3ptechies.com/reviews/namesilo-review.html "Namesilo Review Â– 8 Reasons to Switch to them").

## [IWantMyName (GOOD)](https://iwantmyname.com/ "IWantMyName")

Finally a simple registrar, [IWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.com/ "IWantMyName") is very simple
 and easy to use. Searching for a domain is easy and very user friendly. However I did see some
 issues which I would consider bugs such as the domain I searched for being listed twice in the
 search results. The navigation is easy to use, they even have a link that takes me directly to
 my domains in one click. The pricing however is expensive compared to other registrars. $15 for
 a .com may not sound like much but when you have over 100 domains for example it really adds up
 when comparing $1100 to $1490 in yearly expenses. I would actually consider moving my domains
 here as everything seems really good. If [IWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.com/ "IWantMyName")
 had slightly lower prices I would definitely make the move. As I am with Name.com and I am Swedish
 I am comparing my .com ($10.99 vs $14.90) and .se ($24.99 vs $39) prices. If you are looking for
 an easy to use interface and don't mind the extra price I would definitely recommend [IWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.com/ "IWantMyName").

## [Name.com (GOOD)](https://www.name.com/ "Name.com")

[Name.com](https://www.name.com/ "Name.com") has made several changes to their user interface
since I wrote my last review. They have added a menu system where I now need to perform at least
two clicks to get to my domains. The menus are not easy to navigate either as you might wonder
if you will find a list of your domains under the domains tab or under the account tab. Clicking
the my account tab will show the my domains link as a green heading which I didn't really read
or see as a link as I thought it was simply a green heading. Clicking on the domains tab will
bring up a huge menu which I naturally read from left to right, finally seeing the large green
blob labled "my domains" after scanning through all the other menu options.

Another reason I used to go to name.com was to easily access their whois search to find out
various things like which registrar the domain belongs to or simply when it expires. This
used to be its own link in the header, but now it is hidden in the navigation menu under
"About->Resources" right under the question "What's my IP address".

In my opinion [name.com](https://www.name.com/ "Name.com") has gone backwards in user friendliness,
creating a menu system which is similar to the horrible Godaddy menu system. Name.com is still the
registrar that I use at this time due to good and fair prices. I know they do not use bait and
switch tactics like Godaddy. If Name.com wants to improve I would suggest going back to the old
look and work on that, add a separate drop down menu for all the other services and things you offer
but make things like my domains and whois search easy to access with one click.

## [NameCheap (GOOD)](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/9o105shqnhp4C58AADC4658D9DC6 "NameCheap")

[NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com "NameCheap") has definitely improved it's user interface since
last time. When comparing it to Name.com (my personal favorite) it still takes as many clicks to get
to places but it is not as cluttered, therefore making it quicker to navigate. Prices are about the
same where .com goes for 20 cents less at [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com "NameCheap") but name.com
sells .net domains for a dollar less. They seem to have kept their old interface for handling domains
which is a bit cluttered, if they improve this and make it easier to navigate and use I may actually
consider making the switch to [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com "NameCheap").

## [Dreamhost (GOOD)](http://www.dreamhost.com/ "Dreamhost")

[Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/ "Dreamhost") is mainly a hosting company but also registers
domain names. Domains are decently priced at $11.95 per year but they do seem to throw in extra services
like a .rocks domain name I did not want. Reviews seem good as they are for both hosting and domain names.
 I do however find their control panel to be a bit cluttered like Namecheap. If you are looking to create
 one website [dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/ "Dreamhost") is a pretty good choice but if you want to
 own multiple domains with multiple websites you are probably better off going with something else. They do
 advertise that you can host ecommerce sites on their shared hosting but in all honesty this won't work very
 well unless you are running a very small web store. [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/ "Dreamhost") seems
 good, but they could improve their interface and domain prices to compete with the better registrars.

## [Hover (GOOD)](https://www.hover.com/ "Hover.com")

After [Hover](https://www.hover.com/ "Hover.com") convinced me to take a second look I did a complete review
of them in order to either justify my previous review or prove myself wrong. All I can say is that I was
wrong about Hover, they are a pretty good registrar with perhaps some issues and bad reviews in the past. Their
system does not have the security flaws that it used to have, I didn't do any large tests but was unable to find
anything wrong as of now. Their support seems pretty good both by email and by phone. Ordering a domain was
simple and it is easy to manage settings. The one thing that I don't like is that I can't create an account to
see how their interface works without buying a domain. If [Hover](https://www.hover.com/ "Hover.com") allowed
users to sign up for free without ordering anything they may be able to gain a few more customers who are skeptical.

<del>[Hover](https://www.hover.com/ "Hover.com") seems nice, I thought I would be impressed when I first heard
of it but testing out their site and looking around at what others had to say I am not so sure anymore. There are
many red flags and their pricing is not even that good. You can see many bad reviews [here](http://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/www.hover.com "Hover Reviews")
with and average rating of 14/100\. My recommendation is to stay away, find a different registrar.</del>

## [1and1.com (AVERAGE)](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/e9116tenkem192577A91325A6A93 "1and1.com")

[1and1.com](http://www.1and1.com/ "1and1.com") was the first web host and registrar that I used when I got started
with web development. Their service has always been ok and still is but it is not the greatest. I remember having
some trouble cancelling my services with them when I decided to move to a new host but nothing major. Looking for
reviews brings mixed results mentioning some small issues with their control panel and support systems, but nothing
major. They do seem to use some of the bait and switch tactics we have seen other registrars use where a domain will
be super cheap the first year and then it might be $15 or so to renew. It is an average registrar and most likely
you are better off going with another registrar.

## [Hostgator (AVERAGE)](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/2b74shqnhp4C58AADC46595DA5B "Hostgator")

[Hostgator](http://www.hostgator.com/ "Hostgator") is actually where I bought my first reseller hosting package and
and started my first web hosting company for small clients. I have actually been to a job interview at their Houston
location and got the job but ended up turning it down for an internship that I got. Everything on their hosting and
 domain worked well but I did find better alternatives to their services later on. Their user interface is fairly easy
  to navigate but nothing special. Domains will cost a bit more here, $12.95 to register and about $15 to renew. They
  have had some bad customer support issues but they do seem to be available most of the time.
  [Hostgator is actually an Enom reseller](http://support.hostgator.com/articles/hosting-guide/lets-get-started/domain-names-buy-sell-manage/hostgatorenom-domain-registration "Hostgator/Enom Domain Registration")
  which means that you will most likely receive higher prices from Hostgator. Picking host gator is alright but you are
   most likely better off with a different registrar recommended in this review.

## [Enom (AVERAGE)](http://www.enom.com/ "Enom")

[Enom's](http://www.enom.com/ "Enom") prices are pretty high with domains starting at $13.95\. Their user interface
is also pretty complicated causing you to have to make several clicks to navigate to your domains for example and even
more so if you want to change something like DNS settings. They do offer reseller plans [here](http://www.enom.com/resellers/benefits-pricingplans.aspx "Enom Reseller Plan")
which may be of interest, I received my plan for free when I became a hostgator reseller but don't use it anymore.
I would find a better reseller however unless you are selling enough domains to make use of their best reseller plan.

## [One.com (AVERAGE)](http://www.one.com/ "One.com")

[One.com](http://www.one.com/ "One.com") will require you to get web hosting when registering a domain and overall
the total cost will be a bit pricy. You are not gaining very much by combining these services and one.com's hosting
is nothing special. It's an average registrar and you are better off using a different registrar and host.

## [Gandi (BAD)](https://www.gandi.net/ "Gandi")

[Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/ "Gandi") is new to me, I do like their search function that presents a nice whois
link when a domain is already taken. Domain prices are a little high at around $13\. Digging deeper however I am
finding similar trends to the way Godaddy tries to throw in more services to my order. Their support seems very
slow or unresponsive almost making me wonder whether they are still active. When looking for reviews I only found
negative comments finding the same issues I had encountered as you can see [here](http://www.hostjury.com/reviews/gandi "Gandi Reviews").
Gandi recommends going to their support group [here](http://groups.gandi.net/en/ "Gandi Support Group") where I
found similar issues and not a lot of great support. I would stay away from this registrar for the time being.

## [Yahoo (BAD)](https://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/domains "Yahoo Domains")

[Yahoo](https://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/domains "Yahoo Domains") actually seems pretty nice from the outside. Domains
for only $9.95 sounds great. However Yahoo works like Godaddy, Yahoo will constantly try to sell you other services
and when you have to renew your domain the cost could triple. Many users have also complained about the user interface,
which does not seem to be getting any better. Users have said to get offers which they decline and are then prompted
to login again to verify who they are which brings up the same offer and starts the loop all over again. Have a look
at some of the reviews which can be found [here](http://www.whoishostingthis.com/hosting-reviews/yahoo-hosting/ "Yahoo hosting reviews").

## [Domain.com (BAD)](https://www.domain.com/ "Domain.com")

[Domain.com](https://www.domain.com/ "Domain.com") seems alright from the outside but they do force you to make a
purchase before you can create a so called "free" account. The interface does not seem to cluttered nor does it seem
very good so I am neutral on those aspects. Digging further I did find some horror stories of domain.com clients who
are unable to cancel their domain renewals and hosting, some have even stated that hosting was added to their account
without their acknowledgement. I can't confirm these reviews but there are so many detailed bad reviews that it is hard
to see past it. I would stay away or at least be very careful if you do decide to use domain.com.

## [Network Solutions](http://www.networksolutions.com/ "Network Solutions"), [Register.com](http://www.register.com/ "Register.com") and [Web.com](http://web.com/ "Web.com") (BAD)

I have used Network Solutions which is now part of Web.com when I was running my hosting business. I believe a company
I bought had a server or some services with Network Solutions. I can see that the company has changed quiet a bit since
I was last active on their site. Domains will now cost $27 or more depending on which site you use and it seems that they
would prefer to combine this with other services such as web designs and web hosting. I feel that these companies are only
trying to lure small business owners who want a website and end up having to pay way more than needed because they find these
companies and they seem "safe". I got frustrated that they added my domain to my shopping cart as soon as I found one that
 was available, I felt like I was dealing with a sales person who kept asking me if I wanted to buy every TV that I simply
  looked at in the store. No whois link for domains that were already taken was also another negative point. I would stay
   away from these companies, ask your web designer or web developer what they use and use that instead. Or the best solution,
    look at my thorough review and go with the registrar and host that best suits you.

### [DomainNames.com](http://DomainNames.com/ "DomainNames.com")

DomainNames.com seems very likely to be linked to web.com. When looking around the web you find nothing but bad reviews and
their site is currently only a login screen for support and management of your account. Stay away.

## [THE WORST - Godaddy (BAD)](https://www.godaddy.com/ "Godaddy")

[Godaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/ "Godaddy") has improved slightly on their interface since last years review. However
they still have large menus that are complicated to navigate through and seem to be using the same bait and switch methods
as before. After finally finding a domain that you like you will receive several offers for email, hosting, etc before you
can even get to the cart. All prices seem to have an asterisk or two telling you that their super low price is only valid
if you pay for 2 years or more. Going from previous experience I feel as if [Godaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/ "Godaddy")
wants to lock me in to use their services for as long as possible or to simply get as much money out of me before I leave.
 Looking around for what [Godaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/ "Godaddy") charges for renewals I found several red flags where
 users are getting charged "market prices" for their renewals. You can see a forum thread regarding how [Godaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/ "Godaddy")
 charges way too much for renewals [here](http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1365680 "Godaddy renewals").
 This post [here](http://www.authormedia.com/6-reasons-authors-should-avoid-godaddy/ "6 Reasons Authors Should Avoid Godaddy")
 even gives an additional 6 reasons why you should stay away from [Godaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/ "Godaddy").

#### About this review

Domain registrars reviewed have been nominated by user submissions or comments from our previous review of registrars.
Feel free to leave a comment to nominate next years domain name registrars. Moniker was a considered registrar but due
to site issues I was unable to test and review the site. Looking at reviews Moniker may have placed as average but would
most likely not have been good or best.
