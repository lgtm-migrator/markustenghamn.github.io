**This post has been migrated and imported into different systems over the years, I have not had a chance to format this post so it may be hard to read but I have left it here as a reference.**

Today I will be reviewing [UberChat for Wordpress with Windows Client](http://codecanyon.net/item/uber-chat-ultimate-live-chat-with-windows-client/9963702?ref=Bigideaguy "UberChat for Wordpress") which is a really nice live chat support plugin. You can find the plugin on [CodeCanyon](http://codecanyon.net/?ref=Bigideaguy "CodeCanyon") by following [this](http://codecanyon.net/item/uber-chat-the-ultimate-live-chat-for-wordpress/10692679?ref=Bigideaguy "UberChat for Wordpress") link.  
  
 You can also watch my video review on Youtube by clicking [here](http://youtu.be/8VaMFoj6058 "UberChat for Wordpress Review").  
  
 Let's get started! The plugin comes with a lot of clear documentation, however the first step is pretty easy. We need to upload our plugin either by using an FTP program like [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client "Filezilla") or by simply using the standard add plugin form on your Wordpress site. Then activate the plugin and make sure you don't see any errors.  
  
 When this is done your should see the [UberChat](http://codecanyon.net/item/uber-chat-ultimate-live-chat-with-windows-client/9963702?ref=Bigideaguy "UberChat for Wordpress") menu on the left hand side inside your Wordpress installation. Take a look at the settings page to make sure everything looks correct. For example you may want to change the email that will be used or the categories/pages where your chat box will show. If everything looks good simply head over to your Dashboard, in the top right corner you will see a button called "Go Online". Once this is clicked you will go live. This was the only problem I had with the plugin, when online the "Go offline" button has an animated gif which makes it looks like it is trying to load something. After a short time I realized that it was simply something that indicated that I was online. Perhaps there is a better way of showing that the user is online.  
  
 Once you are active you can test the chat by going to another tab or opening a different browser. The addon seems to use gravatars for users profile pictures. While you are active in the dashboard you will also see that you can see what visitors are currently visiting the site and where they are from. One of the unique things with this addon is the ability to invite users to chat.  
  
 If you look on the left side you will also see that the plugin allows you to see chat logs of previous sessions and form submissions for when the live chat is inactive. You can also setup canned responses. These automated responses can be used while in the chat to send standard messages such as a "welcome, how can I help you?" when the user first enters the chat or answers to common problems that users may have such as finding their way to the checkout page.  
  
 This plugin also includes a windows chat application which will connect to your Wordpress installation and allow you to chat with users without having to have a browser open. In order to set this up you will need the API-Key from your UberChat settings page inside your Wordpress installation. You will also need to provide a username and password for the user who will be chatting to other users. To begin setup navigate to the Windows Client folder and find the .exe file to begin setup. The setup was easy and pretty self explanatory. Once that is done you should find UberChat in your windows start menu. When opened the first time you will need to enter your CodeCanyon username and purchase code which you can get from [CodeCanyon](http://codecanyon.net/?ref=Bigideaguy "Code Canyon")in the downloads section of your profile. Once this is done you will be promted to enter the API key from your [UberChat](http://codecanyon.net/item/uber-chat-ultimate-live-chat-with-windows-client/9963702?ref=Bigideaguy "UberChat for Wordpress") settings area and the login information of the user who should act as the support operator. You can also select from settings such as language, theme and notification sounds. Once logged in you will see the same layout as you did in your dashboard. When a user begins a chat it will pop up in your windows application and you can begin chatting.

 Overall I think the plugin is really great. It seems to run smoother and faster than other live chat support scripts and has all of the basic features. I hope more features will be added in the future as the author of the plugin has created many similar scripts and seems to be an active developer.
