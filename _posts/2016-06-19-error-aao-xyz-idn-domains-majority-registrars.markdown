So lately I tried registering a few .xyz domains containing the swedish characters åäö over at [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/?aff=101681) which failed, [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/?aff=101681) is one of my favorite registrars ([See my review of the best and worst registrars here](http://tenghamn.com/best-and-worst-domain-registrars-my-review-2014)). The fact that my order failed surprised me since I had previously registered swedish domain names with åäö characters without a problem. I would get an error that said "IDN table 'swe' is not supported by this server.". I contacted NameCheap support regarding the problem and they stated that the Swedish language was not supported for .xyz domains.

> [@MarkusTenghamn](https://twitter.com/MarkusTenghamn) The issue is that .xyz IDN domains support a limited number of languages, feel free to check at <https://t.co/AOq1fBdTGj>

 <script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> However I felt that this was wrong as the .xyz website NameCheap refers to mentions languages and scripts, I believe Swedish would fall under Latin. In addition to that, I had already registered Swedish .xyz domains that contained åäö without any issue previously and they would resolve to my server without a problem. So I went ahead and tested an order at [name.com](http://name.com/) which worked without a problem. [(image removed)](http://tenghamn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ClOEiCAXIAAW5Gf.jpg) You can also check the domain [Företag.xyz](http://Företag.xyz) and see that it resolves without an issue. So clearly something was wrong but it seemed hard to get my point across to NameCheap, I went on a bit of a twitter rant but oh well :) I also decided to test registering domains with other registrars that had discounted pricing for .xyz domains at the time. [(image removed)](http://tenghamn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/7b765e3072a3046ac26116766d3605db.jpg)I tested with [Godaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/) ([please note that Godaddy has received some vary bad reviews in my previous posts](http://tenghamn.com/best-and-worst-domain-registrars-my-review-2014)) and they also seem to have the same issue but it does not say exactly why it occured. Next I headed over to [Gandi.net](https://www.gandi.net/) and tried registering a few domains, same problem there as you can see below. [(image removed)](http://tenghamn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ClOKMujUYAAl4E8.jpg)I also headed over to another registrar called [Hover](https://www.hover.com/) and they also seem to be facing the same issue as you can see in the image below. [(image removed)](http://tenghamn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/3671e67969b7b2e79369cdb5cdbbf76e.png)My orders were refunded so not a problem but I would like to register my domains and take advantage of the discounts offered by registrars currently. <del>Since this error affects multiple registrars it seems like this issue is related to a problem with the .xyz registry and we are waiting for an answer, I know that multiple registrars have sent support requests and [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/?aff=101681) has been great in helping me get to the bottom of this issue.</del> **Update June 20th** It's monday and .xyz finally responded confirming that Swedish domains are supported by .xyz and fall under Latin. > .[@MarkusTenghamn](https://twitter.com/MarkusTenghamn) [@namedotcom](https://twitter.com/namedotcom) [@gandibar](https://twitter.com/gandibar) yes. <https://t.co/Xu6AIlkYAK> is swedish and live. It falls under the category of "Latin" ;) — XYZ (@xyz) [June 20, 2016](https://twitter.com/xyz/status/744952871423094784)
