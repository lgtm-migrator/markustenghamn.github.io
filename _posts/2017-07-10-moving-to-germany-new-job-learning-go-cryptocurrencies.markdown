It's been an interesting month to say the least. I sold my apartment 
in Sweden and moved to Germany to start working as a Tech Lead. It was 
a bit of a culture shock but it's not too different from Sweden. The language
is something I will have to work on but I am understanding more and more of 
what is said to me. I was even able to configure my voicemail over the phone 
which I see as a big accomplishment. 

This blog has been very technical over the years, I have had advertising on it, 
guest bloggers, paid posts and more. It's been one big experiment that somehow 
ends up getting 100-200 views per day. From now on I will make the blog more 
personal and more about me. All the old content will remain but any new posts 
will be posted over on my new website called [GoPHP.io](https://gophp.io).

Now why would I start a new website? Well, in my spare time I have decided that
I want to start learning Go as I see it is a strong language in the future. Who 
knows, maybe one day Go will be the new PHP. With Go I can very easily create a 
web server or a native application that will run on Windows, Linux or Mac (without 
needing to install Go). So from now on I will try to keep all the technical stuff 
like how to guides and recommendations on [GoPHP.io](https://gophp.io) while this 
blog will be more about me and my own life. [GoPHP.io](https://gophp.io) will not 
only feature Go, it will also have PHP guides and pretty much anything else that 
is related to Go and/or PHP in some way that I find interesting.

Now, learning Go has been fun. I created a password generator called [password.fun](
https://password.fun), see [lösenord.xyz](https://lösenord.xyz) for the Swedish version.
The site has an API which is open to the public and all the source code can be found
on my Github. Hopefully someone will find it interesting or useful, I like to use
it when I generate passwords for my own accounts.

Finally we get to cryptocurrencies. I had some money left after selling my apartment 
and put most of it in savings but I decided to throw a small amount on cryptocurrencies.
It is a fun topic that I have touched on several times before but never really 
gotten a good grasp on. I am still learning a lot as I write this and I would 
consider myself a complete noob. Please note that with cryptocurrencies you are 
basically taking a gamble as they are queit volatile and sometimes an exchange will
just shut down or get hacked.

I logged into my [BTC-e](https://btc-e.com/) account, I had spent $10 on something
called peercoin a while back and it was no worth $58, cool, wish I had spent more.
After looking around for a bit a decided to put my money in 4 different exchanges. 
Basically BTC-e, Coinbase, Bitstamp and some new exchange called [Cryptopia](https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Register?referrer=uberswe).
Now all of those exchanges except [Cryptopia](https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Register?referrer=uberswe) 
are pretty well known, so why go with this new exchange? [Cryptopia](https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Register?referrer=uberswe) 
has many more coins that are tradable but of course this also turns into higher risk. 
I also think their DOT coin might hold promise if the exchange gets popular with time.
In the end I decided to invest in Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple, Dotcoin and SiaCoin. 
It is probably a bit of a gamble but I will try to keep my eyes closed for a year or 
two to see where it goes.

Hope you enjoyed the post, as always I would love to hear your comments and feedback below!
