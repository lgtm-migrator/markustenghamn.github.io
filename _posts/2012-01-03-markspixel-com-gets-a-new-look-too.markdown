**This post has been migrated and imported into different systems over the years, I have not had a chance to format this post manually so it may be hard to read but I have left it here as a reference.**

Yesterday we launched a completely new design with a new client system and many more products (which we are still in the process of adding) will now be available! If you are an existing client of Markspixel.com you will have received an email about this new change. All existing services such as web hosting remain the same. Swedish clients will be moved later in January. [http://Markspixel.com/](http://markspixel.com/)
