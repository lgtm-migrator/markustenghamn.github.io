I spend quiet a bit of time searching through [VideoHive](http://videohive.net/?ref=Bigideaguy "VideoHive") for videos and ideas. I am pretty impressed by [this month's freebie](http://videohive.net/item/model-show-slide/4807147?WT.ac=free_file&WT.seg_1=free_file&WT.z_author=answer9730&ref=Bigideaguy "This months freebie"), watch the video to see what i mean.  
  
 As always, you can download [this](http://videohive.net/item/model-show-slide/4807147?WT.ac=free_file&WT.seg_1=free_file&WT.z_author=answer9730&ref=Bigideaguy "Model Show Slide") file for free if you are a member. If you're not a member yet then you can always [sign up for free](https://account.envato.com/sign_up?to=videohive&ref=Bigideaguy "Sign up for a free account").  
  
 After downloading the file you can use Adobe After Effects to change text and more in the video in order to make it your own which will work perfectly for your company or business.
