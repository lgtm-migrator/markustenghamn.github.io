**This post has been migrated and imported into different systems over the years, I have not had a chance to format this post manually so it may be hard to read but I have left it here as a reference.**

The new version of [FreeDecsions](http://freedecisions.com/ "FreeDecisions.com") has now launched. Users will now find an easier to use interface that can be used to make decisions. Each decision features its own page and we also have a news page.  
  
 In addition users may create their own account to store and manage decisions they have made. Here they may also add and edit descriptions of what the decision was about and if the outcome has helped them.  
  
 checkout the new page by going to [http://freedecisions.com](http://freedecisions.com/ "FreeDecisions.com")
