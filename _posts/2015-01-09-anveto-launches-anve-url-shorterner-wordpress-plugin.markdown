Recently I wrote a Wordpress plugin for Anveto which will shorten links in your posts automatically as soon as you save them. All you have to do is sign up for a free account at [http://anve.to](http://anve.to "Anve.to URL Shorterner"), install the plugin and then add the API key to get going. When you publish a post you don't have to do anything, the plugin will automatically send any links to Anve.to and shorten them. It will then return the short urls and add them to your post. All shortened links will be tracked inside your account at Anve.to. You can then see statistics on how many users clicked on the links and where they came from. You will find the plugin [here](http://anve.to/tBDGD "Anveto URL Shorterner"). Below is the description for the Anve.to URL Shorterner.  
  
 This plugin automatically shortens outgoing links in your posts using the Anve.to API which is free to use. Users can view statistics of links that have been shortened in the Anve.to dashboard.  
  
 Statistics include:

  
- Number of clicks
  
- Geolocation
  
- Link bundles
  
- Social network tracking
  
- Custom link alias
  
- Public/private link statistics
  
- Password protected statistics
