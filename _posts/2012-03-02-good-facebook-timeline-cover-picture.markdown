 To make a Facebook Timeline picture you really don't need a lot, just a good image that you can upload on your timeline page, however if you would like to get a bit more creative and create something more like these inspiring Timeline pictures: <http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/creative-facebook-timeline-covers/>  
  
 I have attached a psd below to help out with the profile picture and let you create your design around it. The size of the Facebook Timeline Cover is 851px by 315px, this is the best size and will keep Facebook from resizing the photo at all. If you have Photoshop I would definitely suggest using that but if you are looking for a free alternative there is always [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/).  
  
 Here is a sample of how I have the PSD laid out, my complete facebook page is also included so you can see how your image will look with the Facebook layout.
