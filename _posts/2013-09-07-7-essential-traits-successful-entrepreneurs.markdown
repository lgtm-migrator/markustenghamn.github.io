Successful Entrepreneurs stand out, they are a bit different than the rest of us. They have those key traits that make them succeed when the rest of us shudder at the thought of launching our own startup. Below are some of the most essential traits of successful Entrepreneurs.

1. Never Stop
-------------

 Never give up and always keep trying. A good entrepreneur will not stop pursuing a goal because of failure, he or she will stop and look at what caused the failure and learn from the mistakes. An entrepreneur will constantly be thinking through his or her ideas and how they can be improved and implemented in the best ways, sometimes this can only be done through trial and error. 2. A good communicator
----------------------

 When pitching and selling ideas, entrepreneurs are constantly talking to people. This could be anyone from a mentor or family member to a big investor or potential customer. Good communication will make a person come across as more serious and will build trust with the people surrounding the business. 3. Willingness to learn
-----------------------

 Any good entrepreneur constantly wants to find out how things work. Good signs of an entrepreneur is someone who likes to takes things apart to see how they work. As adults you will see these kinds of people asking questions about how things are done and why it was done in that way. They will pull apart ideas to see how they were built and what made them fail or succeed. This constant testing and questioning generates ideas and questions that lead to new startups. Many entrepreneurs attend seminars and events simply to stay educated as an investment in themselves. 4. Promote benefits not features
--------------------------------

 A good entrepreneur knows what people are truly interested in. Features are interesting but it is not what wins customers. Good entrepreneurs realize that it is the benefits of their product or service that wins the customers. 5. A good negotiator
--------------------

 An entrepreneur will be presented with many decisions which he or she will need to make. When it comes to both selling and buying it is good to be a great negotiator to land the deal that will set the business apart from the rest. Perhaps an entrepreneur will need to negotiate the cost of a new office location or the price at which the startup will sell its new product or service. 6. A leader
-----------

 Leadership is an outstanding quality of many entrepreneurs. People will need someone to follow and someone who can make the necessary decision when it counts. As a leader, an entrepreneur needs to know when to take risks and when not to. 7. Ability to look ahead
------------------------

 The ability to see the future, to look past the now and plan for 1 year or even 10 years in the future is crucial. Even if the business is small at the moment an entrepreneur will understand what needs to be done and what can be done to get it to the next level.
