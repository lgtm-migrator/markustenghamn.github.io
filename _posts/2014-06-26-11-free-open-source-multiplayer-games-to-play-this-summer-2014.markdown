Me and my brother decided to find some decent multiplayer games to try over the weekend and here
are a few that we came up with. These are all open source and free to play. At the bottom I have
also listed some games which are free to play but which are not open source. Oh! and all of the
games on this page are multiplayer which is perfect for a lan party or simply to play with friends.
Why did we pick open source games? It's always fun to pick apart games to see how they are built
in order to learn new things!

## Free and open source

**Warsow - Awesome Looking FPS - [http://www.warsow.net/media](http://www.warsow.net/media "Warsow")**
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/kUPlwxQ0cC4" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe>

This was a pretty fun game. Easy and quick to get started, works well with more than 2 players.

Warsow is set in a futuristic cartoonish world where rocketlauncher-wielding pigs and lasergun-carrying
cyberpunks roam the streets. It is a completely free, fast-paced first-person shooter for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

Speed and movement is what Warsow is all about. Like a true cyberathlete you jump, dash, dodge, and walljump
your way through the game. Grab power-ups before your enemy does, plant a bomb before anyone sees you, and steal
the enemys flag before they know what is going on!

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/kfYoSuTUbZI" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Seemed like both players had to open ports in their routers to play online. The campaign seems pretty nice, a lot of story if you like that.

**UFO: Alien Invasion** is a squad-based tactical strategy game in the tradition of the old _X-COM_ PC games, but with a twist. Our game combines military realism with hard science-fiction and the weirdness of an alien invasion. The carefully constructed turn-based system gives you pin-point control of your squad while maintaining a sense of pace and danger.

Over the long term you will need to conduct research into the alien threat to figure out their mysterious goals and use their powerful weapons for your own ends. You will produce unique items and use them in combat against your enemies. If you like, you can even use them against your friends with our multiplayer functionality.
**0AD - Like Age of Empires - [http://play0ad.com/](http://play0ad.com/ "0AD")**

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/vAOtQ7ZC0fg" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Much more detailed than the regular board game Risk, also had a lot of active players.

TripleA is a free online turn based strategy game and board game engine, similar to such board games as Axis & Allies or Risk. TripleA comes with multiple games and over 100 more games can be downloaded from the user community. Supports single player vs AI, hot-seat, Play by Email and Forum, and a hosted Online lobby for live play online.

Recreate World War 2 with the Axis pushing through to Moscow, Japan devouring the Pacific, and the Allies desperately fighting back. Or recreate Napoleon's march across Europe, or Rome defeating the Carthaginian Empire, or Sauron conquering Middle Earth, or even Zombies taking over America! If you have ever played a game where you push little plastic/virtual pieces around, roll dice, conquer the lands of your enemy, & produce new pieces to conquer with, you will be able to jump right into TripleA!
**BZFlag - 3D tanks - [http://bzflag.org/](http://bzflag.org/ "BZFlag")**

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/D9Olk94z6B8" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Bos Wars is a futuristic real time strategy game (RTS). In a RTS game, the player has to combat his enemies while developing his war economy. Everything runs in real-time, as opposed to turn-based games where the player always has to wait for his turn. The trick is to balance the effort put into building his economy and building an army to defend and attack the enemies.

Bos Wars has a dynamic rate based economy. Energy is produced by power plants and magma gets pumped from hot spots. Buildings and mobile units are also built at a continuous rate. Control of larger parts of the map creates the potential to increase your economy throughput. Holding key points like roads and passages allow for different strategies.
