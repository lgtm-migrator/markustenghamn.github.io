I decided to write about this pack of jquery image effects I recently got from [codecanyon](http://codecanyon.net/?ref=bigideaguy).  
  
 You can get the Image Effects Pack [here](http://codecanyon.net/item/image-effects-pack-jquery-powered/136861?ref=bigideaguy)  
  
 This sample and the code they give you is pretty awesome, I stumbled across it while looking for a garage door effect for a website I was working on and changed my mind about which effect to use when I saw what this guy had done with the images. I really liked the effect of splitting the initial image on hover and showing either a second image or text beneath it. Actually it will let you do both, anything you can fit in a div will work.  
  
 Here is an example of me using it on a swedish site I was working on <http://server1.blurple.net/~dolce/>
