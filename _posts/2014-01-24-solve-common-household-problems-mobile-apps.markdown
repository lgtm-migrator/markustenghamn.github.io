The following is a guest post by Nancy Baker, enjoy!  
  
 It's hard to imagine that only a decade ago the app industry didn't exist. Today it is one of the most profitable and pervasive industries in the world, and is responsible for millions of transactions every year. These days there really does seem to be an app for almost everything you want to do, and this can provide you with a unique way to solve issues. Rather than stressing or paying a lot of money for some kind of contractor or consultant, you may just find that you can find an answer to your problem by simply finding the right app…  
  
 And this doesn't just apply to the sorts of problems you're used to solving on your phone or computer either – apps these days can help you even with issues that you have around the home and can help make your property cleaner and more attractive while also saving you money. Read on to see how you can solve every day issues around the home with a simple smartphone…  
  
**Pest Control**  
  
 If you have pests in your home then the best thing to do is of course to call an exterminator. However in the meantime you can also reduce the problem and possibly prevent it from escalating by using one of the many pest control apps. These work by creating a high pitched noise that pests find incredibly off putting, and if you lean your mobile against the wall where they're hiding this can be enough to encourage them to head elsewhere – or at least quieten down instead of scrabbling while you're trying to sleep.  
  
**Security**  
  
 Plenty of apps can help to provide your home with extra security which is a great feature to consider if you want to keep your property and your belongings safer. These work in one of two ways: either by providing you with a remote camera that you can access from another device (leave one Android tablet at home and take a phone out with you for instance), or by providing you with a way to remotely stream footage from a 'proper' CCTV camera. The latter is convenient especially for those who already have cameras installed, while the former may be useful for those who don't have the cash to splash on that kind of security setup.  
  
**Timer**  
  
 There are a thousand and one different uses around the home for your simple timer, whether it's timing how long you cook your eggs for, or testing how long various jobs take in around the home (like your dishwasher) so that you can then set alarms.  
  
**Remote Control**  
  
 Constantly losing the TV remote? Well if your phone happens to have an IR blaster then the good news is that you don't really need one – just download a handy app on your phone and you'll always have a device to hand that can do the job.  
  
 If you don't have an IR blaster then of course you can also use a range of apps that project what's on your phone straight onto the TV screen – which is great for watching YouTube or alternatively showing your holiday photos to friends.  
  
 If you're willing to pay for some extra pieces of tech though, then you can even take this further and turn your phone into a control for your lighting and other electronics. This can even help you to save energy!  
  
**Washing**  
  
 Washing clothes is a chore no one enjoys, but what makes it more frustrating is the fact that different clothes have to be washed on different settings and temperatures. Apps like DressCARE help you to decipher the symbols that come in your clothes labels and thus allow you to avoid ruining your favourite cashmere sweater!  
  
**Baby Monitor**  
  
 If you're a parent then you will no doubt want a baby monitor, but this is another expense you can avoid with the right app. Apps like 'Baby Monitor & Alarm' allow you to turn an Android tablet into a monitor which you can then listen to using your phone in the other room.  
  
 These are just a few examples of apps that have useful everyday roles around the home. So if you're struggling with an annoying problem around the home, then just maybe there's an app for that!
