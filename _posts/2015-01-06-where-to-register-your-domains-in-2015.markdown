Last year I reviewed the [best and worst domain registrars of 2014](http://markustenghamn.com/best-and-worst-domain-registrars-my-review-2014 "Best and Worst Domain Registrars â€“ My Review 2014") and as an avid web developer I do my very best to keep up to date with the best places to register domains for both me and my clients. I have looked at many of the most popular registrars like NameCheap, Godaddy, Name.com and Moniker and as of today I still stand by my choice that I made a little over 2 months ago and that is to go with [NameSilo](http://anve.to/xyR8d "NameSilo"). This is where you should register your domains in 2015!

[NameSilo](http://anve.to/xyR8d "NameSilo") is the best choice when you are registering your domains, it is where I go to register my domains and it is where I recommend my clients go and register all of their domain names. Their domain pricing starts at $8.99 per year with discounts that you can get on top of that if you look around. Privacy protection is always included and not something that you have to pay extra for. When it comes time to renew your domains you still pay the [$8.99](http://anve.to/XPzGT "NameSilo Domain Pricing") low price unlike other registrars like Godaddy [where you may end up paying what they think the value of your domain is when it comes time to renew](http://anve.to/f1Qdk "Pay what your domain might be worth").
