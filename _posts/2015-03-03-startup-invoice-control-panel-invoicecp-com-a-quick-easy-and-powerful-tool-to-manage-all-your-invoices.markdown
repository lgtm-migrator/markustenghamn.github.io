After launching a pretty simple site to create invoices called Faktura.io, where "Faktura" means invoice in Swedish it got me thinking about starting something better and more useful for people who want an easy to use system for creating and managing invoices. Thats when I came across a plugin called [Invoice PRO](http://anve.to/1snEl "Invoice PRO - CodeCanyon") over at [CodeCanyon](http://anve.to/OGp75 "CodeCanyon"). I decided to give it a try and after an hour or so of getting things set up and making a few modifications I had a pretty nice site going. This new site is called [InvoiceCP.com](http://anve.to/QWyn3 "Invoice Control Panel") which is short for invoice control panel. At the moment it is completely free to use but I do plan on adding some premium features later on. Users can create an unlimited number of clients, products and invoices. A PDF is automatically generated for all invoices and can be sent via email. Feel free to give it a try and I would love to hear your feedback in the comments below!
