[Pingdom Tools](http://tools.pingdom.com/ "Pingdom Tools") is a set of tools offered by Pingdom at no cost at all. You can use these tools for free and without registering at [http://tools.pingdom.com/](http://tools.pingdom.com/ "http://tools.pingdom.com/"). Pingdom is a company not too far away from where I live here in Västerås Sweden and I have been in touch with them before. I have probably used their tool for about years now and have seen how its been developed with time. In this case I have been working on a Magento store here in Sweden called BilligaApan.se which I am part owner of. As you can see in the images below the site has been highly optimized and thus being faster than 87% of tested sites on Pingdom. As you may or may not know a 1 second load time and a 800 kb load size is not easy to get with a fully active magento store! (image removed) (image removed) (image removed)
