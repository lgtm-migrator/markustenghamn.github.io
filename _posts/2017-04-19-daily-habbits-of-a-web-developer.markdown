There are some things on the web that I like to take a look at on an almost daily basis
in order to improve, learn new things and keep up to date with whats cutting edge. So the
following will be a list of some of my daily habbits (the good ones at least).

## Versioning

This isn't versioning like git or anything like that, it's Sitepoints own
[daily newsletter](https://www.sitepoint.com/versioning/email)
with lots of interesting topics that show you a bit of what other people are working on and
has a news summary so you know what you missed while programming away. Let's take a look at
what it has to offer today, I am looking at [#614](http://go.sitepoint.com/t/y-3460D6065DAE2D93)
which had about 18000 subscribers. The first link is to a guide about [linear interpolation with
CSS](https://css-tricks.com/between-the-lines/) which I didn't know about until I opened the
newsletter email this morning. Scrolling down you see a guide on
[getting to know xdebug better](https://www.sitepoint.com/getting-know-love-xdebug/)
which reminds me, that's probably something I need to read up on and get better at. Finally
we scroll down to news and see an interesting article that discusses wether [Google is destroying
businesses by being an oracle](https://theoutline.com/post/1399/how-google-ate-celebritynetworth-com).
By subscribing you get one of these emails every day.

## Reddit

Here you kind of have to find your reddits, I love checking out [/r/PHP](https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/)
but there are many more sections out there to explore. I also play a few games and love reading
[/r/EliteDangerous](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/) and [/r/wow](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/)
whenever I have some time to spare.

## Good UI

Now you will only get these emails a few times a month but they are still part of my routine, sometimes
I come back to them when I don't have time to read up on everything the first time. Check out their
[website](http://www.goodui.org/) and feel free to sign up for the newsletter if you want their emails.

## Trending on Github

Check whats trending on a daily, weekly or monthly basis over on [Github Trending](https://github.com/trending).
You can sort this list based on programming language which can be useful if you are not interested in
projects for any language. There is always a few cool projects I find here and it's not all about code either.
People publish courses, guides and more in github projects such as this project which is just a compiled list
of [awesome tools for Windows](https://github.com/Awesome-Windows/Awesome).

## Do some stalking on Stack Overflow

I like to go to Stack Overflow, pick a tag such as [PHP](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/php)
and have a look at the most recent questions and jump over to featured questions. Sometimes I find questions
that have been unanswered that I can contribute to and sometimes I find questions that could help me
learn more or just see how other developers are approaching difficult projects. It's like looking over a
big list of code samples and checking what is good and what is bad.

This are all the things I can think of at the moment. If you have something that you visit on a daily basis
I would love to hear about it.
