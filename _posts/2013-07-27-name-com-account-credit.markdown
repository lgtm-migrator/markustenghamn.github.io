I use name.com all the time for domain purchases and transfers and sometimes I end up with some account credit because a transfer fails or I pay too much perhaps. At the time I had a balance of $8 and was only interested in domains which cost about $11 and I found no way to use the credit towards my cart total. After sending a support email to name.com and getting a quick response I had my answer.

> To add credit to your account: 1. Log into your Name.com account and click the Account button at the top of the screen. 2. Click the View Credit Information link in the control panel on the right of the screen under Billing Menu. 3. Select the amount of credit you would like to add and then click Submit.

 This was fairly easy to do, but it would have been nice to have it automatically subtracted from my cart total. I have asked name.com to consider implementing this since it seems fairly simple and we will see what happens!
