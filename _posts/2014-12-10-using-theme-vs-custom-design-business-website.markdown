I have worked as a web developer for over 8 years now and I have learned a lot from the time I started with clients ranging from artists/authors who needed a personal page to multinational corporations who had more complex requirements. I have also used themes for clients in addition to designing or finding someone who will make a custom design which I will then implement for my clients. What it all comes down to is usually budget. There is nothing wrong with using a theme for your personal page or business. I would suggest that you start thinking about a custom design when your business is ready to start working on branding, this means banners, signs, business cards, envelopes, paper and more. These should all be based on a [corporate identity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_identity "Corporate Identity") which a designer will make for your company. Something like that will cost a lot of money and that may not always be an option for an author trying to get noticed or a startup which is tight on money. In this case it is much smarter to simply get a logo design and then find a theme that fits your business. I recently wrote an [article](http://markustenghamn.com/let-900000-designers-compete-next-design-project "Get 900,000 Designers To Compete For Your Next Design Project") about 99Designs where you can get [900,000+ designers to give you many different logo options and let you pick the best one for only $250](http://www.kqzyfj.com/4r70lnwtnvAIBEGGJIACBIKFIBE?cm_mmc=CJ-_-3944865-_-7035587-_-Logo%20Store%20-%20Text "Get 900,000 Designers To Compete For Your Next Design Project"). Now, there are tons of places to find themes, some are free and some are premium. I prefer premium themes with good ratings from [Themeforest](http://themeforest.net/?ref=Bigideaguy "Themeforest"), they will usually cost around $40 perhaps and there are tons of good ones. You can usually find a web developer who will install the theme on your web host and make basic configurations for around $100 or even less depending on the complexity. I own a web design firm and can take care of this for you if needed, simply contact us over at [Anveto Designs](http://anvetodesign.com/ "Anveto Designs") ([http://anvetodesigns.com](http://anvetodesigns.com "Anveto Designs")). Free themes would be the last option and you have to be careful when using these as some have been known to contain backdoors/malware that could cause your business problems in the long run. In the past I have found some really nice themes over at [Freebiesbug](http://freebiesbug.com/code-stuff/free-wordpress-themes/ "Free Wordpress Themes"). I hope my post was helpful and I would love to hear your thoughts and feedback in the comments section below, thanks for reading!
