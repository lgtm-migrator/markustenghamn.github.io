I am not sure what Dashview is yet. The reason for starting it is to make a CMS that
will allow me to create Laravel 5 based websites quickly using a similar structure to
Wordpress. It should be simple to use like Wordpress but also very customizable so that
you can use all of the dependencies that have been created for Laravel. You can see and read more about the project on the [Dashview Github page](https://github.com/markustenghamn/Dashview).
My website [Dashview.io](http://dashview.io) will be a sort of playground or demo of what you
could achieve with a dashview website.
