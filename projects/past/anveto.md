[Anveto](http://anveto.com) was my first every corporation based in Sweden and I learned a lot running this startup.
Everything from pitching to investors, getting a board members course, buying and selling shares
and meeting tons of new people. What I focused on was analytics with the addition of eye tracking.
I had a really good thing going with companies willing to test my project but it ultimately failed
as I had expenses I could not pay without taking on freelance work. This freelance work was done at
a really low price now that I look back at what I did and it took up all the time I otherwise would
have had to finish my idea. I made myself feel used by being too nice to customers, I ended up disliking what I did
and it didn't make me happy any more. But there was another problem, I spent too much time trying to perfect
what I had created and thus I never reached the point where I could get it to a beta stage and any companies
that had been interested forgot about it. I then took on a job and slowly shut the business down.

I don't regret starting this company, I know what I did wrong and it was a good experience. There are
a lot more worse things I could have been wasting my time on.
