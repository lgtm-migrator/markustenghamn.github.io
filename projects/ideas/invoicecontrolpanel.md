InvoiceControlPanel or InvoiceCP was going to be a platform where you could log on and manage
invoices. It was inspired by [WHMCS](https://www.whmcs.com/) and [InvoiceNinja](https://www.invoiceninja.com/).
I had already gotten started with the basic building blocks for this when making Anveto so it
would not have been too hard to get the basics up and running. What I quickly realized however is
that there are already so many alternatives for something like this so why should I reinvent the
wheel? I have put this on hold until I think of some good way that I could beat the competition.
Laws regarding transactions, invoices, taxes and receipts also makes this a very complex project.
