I had an idea to create a open source directly, mainly focused around phone
numbers. Nummer means number in swedish and is a good name for the swedish
market but it is not that nice for an english speaking market since it sounds
similar to numb or might even be confused with number. I have a domain called
[Nusay](http://nusay.com/) which may be a better choice and it has no meaning.
Perhaps say makes it related to speaking, you speak on a phone, makes sense maybe? :)
