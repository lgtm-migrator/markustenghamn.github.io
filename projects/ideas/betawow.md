Betawow for the lack of a better name is to create a platform for wow guilds and players
something better than the sites like [Enjin for guild websites](https://www.enjin.com/game/wow-guild-website-hosting) that
would combine stats like [wowprogress](https://www.wowprogress.com/) and [warcraftlogs](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/).
Most of the current websites feel a bit old and could use some improvement but this would
take lots of time and work and that is something that I don't have at the moment.
