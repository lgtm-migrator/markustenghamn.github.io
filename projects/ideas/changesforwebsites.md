ChangesForWebsites.com is exactly what the domain name says. I hear so many people
complain about hiring a web developer who makes a website that they later want to change.
Usually the developer can not be found or perhaps the customer wasn't happy with the developer.
There is a lot of money to be made here and some of it is pretty easy, you could even sell
support plans in order to generate a recurring income.

I haven't started this as it requires a lot of work for not a lot of profit. I am sure you could
scale it up nicely if you had the right business model but there is nothing interesting here,
no innovation.
