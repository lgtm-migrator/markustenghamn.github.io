You may have seen my other project called [Tournify](/projects/current/tournify).
Bracket.xyz is basically a spin off of that site where users would be able to
easily create brackets for anything. All the user would need to do is enter teams
and click go to generate a bracket. Teams and positions could then be moved around.
Advertising would be the first thing that comes to mind regarding profit but what I
would have liked to do is have a free version for bracket creation and then a pro (paid)
version which allows you to tweak things more and even save templates for repeat use.
