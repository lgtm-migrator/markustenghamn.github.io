Beubo is what I would call my addons that would be made to connect Slack with different platforms.
I have already made the [WHMCS Slack addon](https://github.com/markustenghamn/WHMCS-Slack) which
connects WHMCS to Slack and my idea was to copy this concept to Wordpress, Magento, Joomla, etc. and
make them paid or subscription addons. Slack is a great application and this is a project I really
would like to spend more time on if I did have the time for it. I even have the design files ready to go.
