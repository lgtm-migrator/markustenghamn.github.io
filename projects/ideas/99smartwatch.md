I had an idea to create websites for smart watches. Basically making
it easy for companies to convert their current website to fit and be
usable on a smart watch. I feel like this idea may be a bit early, we
are just seeing the first decent smart watches and their popularity is
dying. Until we have curved displays that are a bit larger I don't think
that this will be a good business idea. Something to put in the vault for
a day in the future.
