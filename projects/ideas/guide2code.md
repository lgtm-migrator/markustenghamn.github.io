I love teaching others programming and how to code and this was going to be my new site
where I would do so. I had already set up a [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) site where I began
making lessons that I could initially give away for free but probably sell as they became better
and more popular. I put this on hold as it takes a lot of time to make good lessons, I hope that
I can pick this back up again one day.
