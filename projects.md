On this page I have listed some of the projects I am currently working on, 
have worked on in the past or have ideas for. Most of these are hobby projects.
Projects I work on at work are most likely not going to be listed here.

Why do I list my projects here? Mostly for me to keep track of and keep myself
motivated for the things I do as a hobby. Am I worried someone else will steal my
ideas? A little I guess but not too worried, I have a good domain for each project
and I believe I have the full picture of the project which I don't share here. Anyone
is free to join my projects and help contribute to them in their respective Github repositories.
If there is a past project someone would like to take control of feel free to send me an email
and we will discuss it.
