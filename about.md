I consider myself a backend PHP developer, self taught with over 10 years of experience.

My skillset is not limited to PHP, I have held many roles that allowed me to
learn and master other areas such as server management, cloud hosting, node.js and golang.
A lot of my most recent work involves real time analysis and processing of data for some of the
largest companies in Scandinavia.

I love the work that I do and here on my blog you will find posts about things that I find
interesting and hopefully others will find them helpful. My blog is a bit of an experiment
where I try to show off my work related to optimization and web development. Read more about what
interests me and if you have a question or have something that you think might interest me then
feel free to contact me.
